# Medicare Fraud Detection using Isolation Forests

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions within Medicare payment data. By employing machine learning models, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm, the project seeks to detect outliers that may indicate fraud.

## Data Source
Data is sourced from the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/hhs/medicare?project=resonant-amulet-327023).

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing data features for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training an Isolation Forest to identify potential fraud.
